You are encouraged to reuse code from past tutorials to help you with these exercises.\n","\n"," The parts of this assignment build on themselves -- you *really* don't want to get stuck early on here. Please get started early and don't be afraid to ask for help.\n","\n"," ## A note about notebook cells\n","\n"," Beneath each exercise description there is a single code cell. This is not to suggest that you should do all your work in a single cell. Please create as many as you need via the \"Insert\" menu in the notebook menu bar.\n","\n"," Another thing worth noting (as I mentioned in class) the Twitter API is rate limited, so it's worth making your API call in a seperate cell from the code you write to manipulate the result. That will avoid having the API call repeat every time you run the cell as you're debugging."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" # Exercise: Retweet network\n","\n"," Here we want to produce a **directed** graph of users **retweeting** each others' tweets.\n","\n"," (Note - please read this overview of the assignment before diving in - it might be helpful to have a firm idea of each required step before you start)\n","\n"," * 1.)
